Bob Diddlebob is a 29 year old single restaurant owner in Las Vegas. He got his MBA from the University of Texas at San Antonio, and has worked under a few other chefs before deciding to try and start his own business. Bob is no technological genius, however, he is familiar with the various systems needed to run a business.
Bob is in need of a soda supplier that can provide him with regular shipments of soda in bulk, hopefully  a discounted price. He will also need to be able to keep records of past orders that have been placed for verification purposes, and for various other overhead purposes. As a new restaurant wonder, Bob has a lot on his plate at all times, and needs an easy, reliable way to stock his restaurant with soda.
