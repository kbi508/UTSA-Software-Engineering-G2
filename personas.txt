Amanda Hawkins is a 23 year old UT Austin student currently majoring in Economics. She lives alone in a student apartment and studies full time, supported by generous scholarships and savings. Amanda is a homebody most of the time, preferring to stay in and study. She likes to order food in, and like many other zoomers her age, is not particularly social. She uses the internet proficiently, searching and surfing site like Youtube, Amazon, and facebook. Amanda enjoys many different types of beverages, but particularly diet coke. She likes to ship primarily online, both to save the travel and shopping time, and to avoid crowds and potentially awkward social situations. 

Amanda mainly is able to get whatever she needs from online shipping. She gets all her clothes from Amazon, gadgets from newegg, and occasionally a great deal off walmart.com. The main thing that causes her to have to go into the nearby supermarket is her supply of diet coke. Amanda would like a way to avoid this extra trip so that she doesn't have to stress just to keep her fridge stocked. She does not have a roommate unfortunately, so the shopping duties cannot be shared.
